Most of the thick lines (showing strong betweeness) surround Mr Hi and John A as they are leaders and shows that most connections pass through them. Some members may not have connections with strong betweeness (thick lines) but removing them would very much affect the club. Like in the case of Actor 31, they do not have connections with particularly strong betweeness but removing them would affect the club as they connect a few members of the club who further connect to other members."

It shows that the migration is limited to Central and South Asia. There is no cross continent movement, but there is cross country movement southward from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and China among the few. The map shows mostly southward movement of the birds. This might imply that the migration is due to colder months in Krygyzstan, because as you move southward in Asia, those regions comparitively have warmer climates. Although there is one instance where the movement is partially northward towards Kazakhstan but since it is lower in altitude, it is warmer in climate."

This also shows some back and forth movement and it also shows there are more bends and zig zags in their routes. There is also overlap in routes of the some of the birds while migrating like seen in the movement taking place between longitudes 76E and 82E and latitudes 32E and 40E."

There are quite a few restaurants clustered at the centre (18.52N, 73.87E), top right (between 18.53N, 73.90E and 18.54N, 73.90E) and towards the bottom left (18.51N, 73.85E) of the map. This suggests that those might be busy areas, maybe even commercial or at least where there is quite some activity of people. There is a wide variety of cuisines identified showing that Pune’s food is diverse. Apart from Indian food, there seems to be a strong liking for Chinese among the people based on the number of restaurants serving Chinese. Italian food also seems to be popular, along with Thai and Asian. There are also a presence of American food. There are only a few restaurants along the river and around the tree areas, suggesting there might be only a few to no people living there. The restaurants are closer to the roads and buildings, that is, they are placed mostly near urban areas."

The other routes are not very important as they are represented by thin and darker blue lines. This means only a small number of routes are used over and over again to connect to different airports in the network. The routes which have high betweeness between them, that is the thicker, lighter blue routes, connect airports to each other, making them extremely important. If any one of these airports are affected, it would in turn affect a lot of dependent airports."

There are some major airports which are less visited than the smaller airports suggesting that the number of flights do not depend on the number of connections."

Some of the smaller airports (points coloured in blues and purples) have more flight frequency than the major airports (points coloured in yellows and greens)."
