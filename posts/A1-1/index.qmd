Airbnb <- read_csv("../Data/airbnb.csv")
Airbnb
```

glimpse(Airbnb)
```

Comments-
There are 9995 rows and 1 column, which is the variable- price, in this dataset 

## Data Dictionary

Quantitative Data-

price (dbl): Prices of various Airbnbs on the French Riviera

## Displaying prices of Airbnbs a graph

```{r}
Airbnb %>% 
  gf_histogram(~price, color = "red", fill = "pink", alpha = 0.8)
```

Comments-
There are a lot more Airbnbs which are listed at lower prices than one listed at higher prices.
